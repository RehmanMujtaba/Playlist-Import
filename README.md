# Youtify

Youtify is a web app to moves your music playlist between YouTube and Spotify, and also generates "clean" versions of those playlists.

Youtify is currently deployed on Vercel [here](https://youtify-neon.vercel.app/), however, I am waiting for approval from the Youtube and Spotify API team for a large enough API quota to make the app public. So, while the website will open, logging in will not work.

For a detailed demo, you can contact me at rehmanmujtaba@outlook.com.

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/RehmanMujtaba/youtify
cd youtify
npm install

# Create .env file with YOUTUBE_CLIENT_ID, YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET, SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
# Add your credentials to the Google and Spotify cloud interface
# Add htpp://localhost:3000 to the approved redirect URIs
# Instructions to do all of this can be found online

npm run dev

# Open htpp://localhost:3000
```
